## Set-Up

To deploy this project you will need an updated version of Python.
First, we will create a virtual enviroment. You can do it with
```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
```
Now, we need to activate the virtual enviroment.
On linux, just type
```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
```
on Windows,
```bash
   venv/Scripts/activate
```
Once activated, we need to install Flask and other libraries:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Lastly, we run the proyect with:
```bash
  flask run
```

and access it through typing [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) in your browser
